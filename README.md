# Assignment-7.1-Final-Project-and-Presentation
Overview
Create a web application game or other application of your choice. It must contain:

Navigation menu
HTML5
CSS
JavaScript
PHP
JSON or XML
The jQuery page you created in the previous assignment.
Data retrieved from MySQL DB and displayed on at least 1 PHP web page
Implement a Testing strategy involving reliability, accuracy, and UI testing. Demonstrate the testing strategy with screenshots or a video.
The application should not be something that just demonstrates the requirements, it should "do" something.
Presentation demonstrating how the application works.
Guidelines 
1. You must submit a web application. 

2. Include thorough code comments.

3. Design a great User Experience.

Deliverable
Provide a video of you navigating between the pages in your web application, along with a demonstration that all of the code is working. Keep your video to 5 minutes or less. (I will only watch the first 5 minutes.)
Provide a link to the source code in GitHub.
Projects that significantly exceed the requirements will need prior approval from the instructor and may require a code review to receive credit.
